This R package provides functions for the chi-bar-squared distribution,
the bivariate chi-bar-squared distribution, and the conic intrinsic volumes.
It supports standard functions for the density/cdf/sampling of the (bivariate)
chi-bar-squared distribution, calculations and known formulas for special classes
of intrinsic volumes of cones, sampling functions for ellipsoidal cones and
general polyhedral cones, as well as functions for estimating intrinsic volumes
either from direct samples of the intrinsic volumes distribution
(in the case of polyhedral cones) or from samples of the corresponding
bivariate chi-bar-squared distribution. The package supports point estimates
as well as Bayesian estimates via JAGS and Stan.

## Installation

You can install conivol from github with:

<!-- {r gh-installation, eval = FALSE} -->
<!-- # install.packages("devtools") -->
<!-- devtools::install_github("damelunx/conivol") -->


## Functions

The following functions are exported (sorted by context):

### Chi-bar-squared distribution
* `dchibarsq`: evaluates the density
* `pchibarsq`: evaluates the cumulative distribution function
* `rchibarsq`: produces samples

<!-- See [this vignette](vignettes/conic-intrinsic-volumes.html) for more information about the chi-bar-squared distribution. -->

### Bivariate chi-bar-squared distribution
* `dbichibarsq`: evaluates the density
* `pbichibarsq`: evaluates the cumulative distribution function
* `rbichibarsq`: produces samples

<!-- See [this vignette](vignettes/conic-intrinsic-volumes.html) for more information about the bivariate chi-bar-squared distribution. -->

### Computing with conic intrinsic volumes
* `comp_ivols_product`: computes the intrinsic volumes of a product cone by convolving the intrinsic volumes of its elements
* `estimate_statdim_var`: estimates the statistical dimension and the variance of the intrinsic volumes from samples of the corresponding bivariate chi-bar-squared distribution

### Computations involving products of circular cones
* `circ_ivol`: computes the intrinsic volumes of (a product of) circular cones
* `circ_rbichibarsq`: produces samples from the bivariate chi-bar-squared distribution with weights given by the conic intrinsic volumes of a product of circular cones


### General polyhedral cones
* `polyh_reduce`: computes a reduced representation of a polyhedral cone given by generators
* `polyh_samp_ivol_gen`: produces samples from the intrinsic volumes distribution of a polyhedral cone given by generators
* `polyh_samp_ivol_ineq`: produces samples from the intrinsic volumes distribution of a polyhedral cone given by inequalities
* `polyh_rbichibarsq_gen`: produces samples from the bivariate chi-bar-squared distribution with weights given by the conic intrinsic volumes of a polyhedral cone given by generators
* `polyh_rbichibarsq_ineq`: produces samples from the bivariate chi-bar-squared distribution with weights given by the conic intrinsic volumes of a polyhedral cone given by inequalities

### Estimating the weights of the bivariate chi-bar-squared distribution
* `prepare_data`: evaluates the sample data of the bivariate chi-bar-squared data (find the corresponding chi-squared density values); this potentially time-consuming step is called during find_ivols_EM and can be computed outside and passed as parameter to avoid multiple calls should find_ivols_EM be called more than once
* `init_v`: find an initial estimate of the weights, potentially based on first and/or second moment
* `comp_loglike`: compute the log-likelihood of a weight vector for specific sample data
* `find_ivols_EM`: produces EM-type iterates that may or may not converge to the maximum likelihood estimate for the weights of the bivariate chi-bar-squared distribution from sample data; as the likelihood function is quite flat around its maximum, the function supports several ways to introduce some (well-founded) bias and thus improve the estimate. See the example below and [this vignette](vignettes/estim-conic-intrinsic-volumes-with-EM.html) for a description of this parameter tuning.

## Example

<!-- ```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE} -->
<!-- library(conivol) -->
<!-- library(Rmosek) -->
<!-- library(tidyverse) -->
<!-- ``` -->
<!-- We consider the product of two circular cones, one 5-dimensional and another -->
<!-- 8-dimensional. -->
<!-- ```{r} -->
<!-- # specify the dimensions -->
<!-- D <- c(5,8) -->
<!-- # specify the angles -->
<!-- alpha <- c( 0.7*pi/2, 0.8*pi/2 ) -->
<!-- # get the exact intrinsic volumes -->
<!-- v <- circ_ivol(D, alpha, product = TRUE) -->
<!-- # plot the values and its logarithms -->
<!-- d <- sum(D) -->
<!-- ggplot(tibble(k=0:d, v=v), aes(x=k,y=v)) + -->
<!--     geom_line() + -->
<!--     theme_bw() -->
<!-- ggplot(tibble(k=0:d, `log(v)`=log(v)), aes(x=k,y=`log(v)`)) + -->
<!--     geom_line() + -->
<!--     theme_bw() -->
<!-- ``` -->

<!-- The goal is to reconstruct these values from samples from the bivariate -->
<!-- chi-bar-squared distribution with the above intrinsic volumes as weights. -->
<!-- ```{r} -->
<!-- # set sample size -->
<!-- n <- 10^5 -->
<!-- # obtain sample of the specified size -->
<!-- set.seed(1234) -->
<!-- m_samp <- circ_rbichibarsq(n,D,alpha) -->
<!-- # scatter plot of the sample -->
<!-- ggplot(as_tibble(m_samp), aes(V1,V2)) + geom_point(alpha=.02) + -->
<!--     theme_bw() + -->
<!--     theme(axis.title.x=element_blank(),axis.title.y=element_blank()) -->
<!-- ``` -->
