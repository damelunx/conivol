Description: --TBD--
    A package for computing the conic intrinsic volumes and
    chibarsquare distribution of products of circular cones, and
    for estimating the intrinsic volumes of a closed convex cone
    from projection data. The projection data has to consist of two values:
    (1) the squared norm of a point in the ambient space, randomly
    sampled from the corresponding standard normal distribution, and
    (2) the squared norm of its projection on the cone.
    The main function for the intrinsic volumes estimation produces EM-type
    iterates, which should converge to the maximum likelihood estimate, if the
    starting point has been chosen well. Different choices of starting points,
    using products of circular cones or user-specified parameters, are
    supported. See conivol website for more information.
